<P>Hi Ken, </P>

<P>Thanxs for your well done work. Here are the informations you 
need from the author and editor itself. </P>

<P>Ashes of Empire was an original Software Programme from Mike Costello 
from 1982 (Spektrum, oric, etc.). I was the German programmer for the 
C-64-Commodore-Basic-Version. In the mean-time it«s available for the PC 
DOS/WIN Dual Version for DM 25,00 on 3.5" disk (not the one from Bomico! 
That one had to be renamed to Fallen Empire ;-)).</P>

<P>The Ashes boardgame is from 1992 and was published at the games event in 
Essen Gruga halls called SPIEL '92. Author is Thomas Dellenbusch and 
Harald Topf (it's me). Published by CSPP = Computerspiele per Post, also 
a pbm-company. German price is about DM 99.00 Trader price is DM 60.00 
netto plus VAT. </P>

<P>If you need any other information mail me under 
<A HREF="mailto:h.topf@cspp.com">h.topf@cspp.com</A> or take a 
look at cspp or ABAS-homepage.</P>

<P>Best regards to the island</P>

<P>Hi!</P>

<P>I read your review/rules of Ashes of Empire and I think I can provide you
with some more information about it.</P>

<P>The game was designed as a PBM by Mike Costello (GB). Harald Topf (Germany)
got the license for this game and it started to become Germanys most-played
PBM. The board game was designed some years later by Harald Topf, Holger
Rinke and Efro Brandimarte. Maybe I have been one of the designers, but I'm
too shy too mention it. (   ... but if you would like to mention me, I
would not hesitate ;-)   )</P>

<P>Ashes was published by:</P>

<P>The original PBM is still alive (I wrote the Windows version). If there is
anyone out there, who has a question about the game (board or computer)
send me a mail.</P>
