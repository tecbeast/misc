<LI>8 wooden dice
<LI>11 bags
</UL>

<H2>E2.1 The Board</H2>

<P>The board shows 40 planets around which the game revolves. If it surprises you
that all the planets have neither neighbouring planets nor suns, then it should
be mentioned here that these are actually in existence, but are not taken into
consideration as one cannot settle them on the fewest planets and in the most
solar systems. In this game only planets that can be colonised are of importance,
all other worlds not being taken into consideration. When looking at the cards
you will notice that the planets stand in different distances to one another. Any
attempt to communicate this in any coordinate grid was doomed to failure, so in
this game there is a table at the end of the rules booklet which shows how
quickly one planet can be reached by another. As a matter of priority the board
must show the owner of each planet and give an overview of the situation in this
game. </P>

<H2>E2.2 The Rules</H2>

<P>The sections of the rules are accompanied by a capital letter.</P>

<UL>
<LI>E Introduction
<LI>G Basic Game
<LI>A Extension rules
<LI>Z Additional rules/game end
</UL>

<H2>E2.3 The Postal Rules</H2>

<P>There is a postal game of the same name. </P>

<H2>E2.4 The Planet Boards</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Bevotheriung = population
<LI>Bodentruppen = land troops
<LI>Werft	= hangar
<LI>Fabrik	= factory
<LI>Entfernung = distance
<LI>Planeten-Umlaufbahn = orbit of planet
</UL>

<P>In the game there are 42 game boards : you need only 40 of these. Before the
first game you should make the effort to stick the enclosed self sticking numbers
in the boards in the spaces marked &quot;NR&quot;, otherwise you will get into
terrible confusion during the course of the game. You will notice that from the
beginning the planets have a different number for population. So when sticking on
the numbers, proceed as follows : </P>

<P>On boards with a population of 1 stick :<br>
21,26,27,28,29,31,,37,38,39 and 40</P>

<P>On boards with a population of 2 :<br>
9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,22,23,24,25,30,32,33 and 35</P>

<P>On boards with a population of 3 :<br>
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,20, and 34</P>

<P>In the population space there is a number which shows the population already
there. this population can not be transported away in any of the game variants.
You can only transport away population in excess of this number. </P>

<P>If the population of a planet becomes higher, you simply place the
corresponding number counter on the space. The population of a planet cannot rise
about 9 units. On the land troop space place the corresponding game counters.
There must always be at least the same number of troops as population, otherwise
there is a robot. There are also spaces for 2 hangars and 3 factories. In these
spaces you can place the corresponding counters if a hangar or factory is built,
Whether you build , for example 3 steel factories or one of each type is left to
your choice. The distance number spaces and the planet orbit will be explained
later on.</P>

<H2>E2.5 The Central Warehouse Boards</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Ol	= Oil
<LI>Stahl = Steel
<LI>Summe Bevolher = sum of population
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Feind  = Enemy
<LI>Freund = Friend 
</UL>

<P>Each player has his own central warehouse board. Here there are spaces for the
acquired raw materials of oil, steel and high tech. There is also an area for the
sum of all the population a player possesses in his planets and a list of the
game phase order. For the extension game there are spaces for the political
relationship. </P>

<P>The central warehouse is not located on any specific planet so it can not be
captured.</P>

<H2>E2.5 The Game Counters</H2>

<P>There are 1452 of these in 8 different colours. There are also white ones
which are for all players.</P>

<H3>Jager - Fighter plane</H3>

<P>These counters have quantities 1,2,5 and 10. The fighters form the backbone of
the military might of a player. Air battles are conducted with them. There are 95
fighters on 25 counters at your disposal. In addition there are 33 counters with
75 fighters in total which represent neutral pirate fleets. With the.loss of your
own colour counters, these can be used as replacement.</P>

<H3>C - Kolonies</H3>

<P>This C stands for colonies or control. The colonies of a player are marked on
the board with these counters. There are 25 of these counters. </P>

<H3>HP - Home Planet</H3>

<P>The home planet of a player is marked on the board with this counter. there is
only one of these counters for each player.</P>

<H3>Number counters</H3>

<P>The player can mark all relevant data on the corresponding game boards with
these counters. There are no &quot;0&quot;'s as these are already marked on the
game board. There are 74 of these counters.</P>

<H3>Population, Oil, Steel, High Tech</H3>

<P>There are freight counters. They are needed to mark the transport of
population, oil, steel and high tech. They are marked with their cargo ships.
There is one each of these counters at you disposal.</P>

<P>White counters can be used by all the players. </P>

<H3>Transporter</H3>

<P>these counters have the quantities 1,2,3 and 5. Apart from their normal use
for the attack on land troops, they can also be used for the transport of
civilian goods. They are the only means of capturing a planet. There are 180
transporters on 75 counters. </P>

<H3>Oil Factory, Steel Factory, High Tech Factory </H3>

<P>These are need to mark factories on the board. </P>

<H3>Fighter Hangar; Transport Hangar</H3>

<P>These are required if you want to build a transporter or fighter on that planet. With a hanger
you can build as many of that type as you wish, so long as the resources are still sufficient.
There are 36 counters of each type.</P>

<H3>Land Troops</H3>

<P>These are of the quantities 1,2,3 and 5. They are required for the defence of a planet. A
further task is to look after the feelings of the people, to avoid revolts. With all the counters there is the rule :&quot;What is not there cannot be built&quot;. So it is not
possible to build another steel factory if all 39 steel factory counters are already in use.</P>

<H2>E2.7 The Dice.</H2>

<P>There are 5 6-sided dice.</P>

<H2>E3 The construction</H2>

<P>Before one has the pleasure of playing you firstly have to deploy the
counters, positions and boards. The allocation of positions is detailed in the
list of &quot;game positions&quot;. now each player picks out a counter colour
and marks his home planet (the planet with the lowest number) on the board with
his HP counter as well as marking the other planets which he controls with a C
counter. For each planet the player receives the corresponding planet board.
These are occupied with as many land troops as the number of population on the
board. On each planet is placed a factory of the player's choice. On the home
planet and the &quot;stamm&quot; colony (the planets with the lowest numbers)
there is built a hanger of the player's choice (not in the basic game). The
allocation of the fleet can be gathered from the list of &quot;start
positions&quot;. In the central warehouse each player places 5 units of each raw
material by putting down number counters. Under &quot;Summe Bevolkerung&quot; the
sum of a players' population units on all planets is marked down with number
counters. </P>

<H2>E3.1 Game Positions</H2>

<P>First, it has to be said that you can play Ashes of Empire with any number of
players between 2 and 8 and you can allocate start positions arbitrarily. The
positions suggested here are in this respect not binding. Through the positions
with Ashes of Empire are created different strengths of neighbouring planets and
different flight ranges as well as very different set ups. The positions
suggested here have a certain equilibrium, which is not necessarily guaranteed
with other strength combinations. </P>

<H2>E3.1.1 Game Scenarios for 2 players</H2>

<P>I. In a time of economic crisis, the colonies detached themselves from Earth.
Only on Barnard's Arrow and Crossland can the Empire maintain its power. Lenin,
Last Hope and Einstein form a new state which unlike the remaining colonies are
successful in keeping and using the standard of industry. Now begins the race of
the ancient power with the up and coming young state over leadership of the
galaxy. Who will win?</P>

<P>Player 1 : Erde (1), Barnard's Arrow (9), Crossland (20) Player 2 : Lenin (5),
Last Hope (13), Einstein (34) </P>

<P>On each home planet 10 fighters + 3 transporters On any one colonial planet 5
fighters + 3 transporters </P>

<P>II. The empire has collapsed. The states of Eastside and Sombrero sense their
chance to succeed. They still have no points of contact and their aim is the same
- the final shattering of the empire.</P>

<P>Player 1 : Sombrero (7) Tromp (15), New Earth (22) Scott's Home (23) Murphy
(25), Aitchison (26), New Jerusalem (31) and Kaironow(38) Player 2 : Eastside
(3), Desert Rock (11), Beyond (21), Newton (24), Atlas (28), New Mecca (29),
Evergreen (30) and Lermontov(33). </P>

<P>On any three planets 5 fighters + 3 transporters </P>

<H2>E3.1.2 Game Scenarios for 4 players</H2>

<H2>E3.1.3 Game Scenarios for 5 players</H2>

<H2>E3.1.4 Game Scenarios for 6 players</H2>

<H2>E3.1.5 Game Scenarios for 8 players</H2>

<H2>The Basic game</H2>

<P>The game proceeds with the following phases in order. </P>

<H2>G4.1 Align political relationships</H2>

<P>This is an element of the extension rules and explained there (A.4.1) </P>

<H2>G4.2 Establish building orders</H2>

<P>All the players determine the production of their planets. For this purpose the counters which
show what is to be built are placed face down on the space with the corresponding planet
number.</P>

<P>The building order is not yet carried out </P>

<P>Each production plan requires raw materials which must be in stock in the central warehouse.
Both fighters and transporters in as many quantities as you which dependent on the raw
material can be built on each of your own planets. The following table shows which resources are required for building of a product.</P>


<H3>Required resources</H3>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TH>Product</TH><TH>Oil</TH><TH>Steel</TH><TH>High Tech</TH></TR>
<TR><TH>Fighter</TH><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD></TR>
<TR><TH>Transporter</TH><TD>2</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD></TR>
<TR><TH>Land troops</TH><TD>-</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>In the basic game there can be a maximum of one factory which is already
available with its capture.</P>

<P>No hangars are necessary in order to build fighters or transporters. The
counters are placed face down on the command sheet to keep the orders secret.
With this system the game leader has a small advantage since he knows the total
quantity the other players wish to build. But this is balanced by the fact that
the must establish his order before then. Even is this is not the case, this
advantage is further made up for the fact that he must distribute the counters
and therefore has less time to think about his turn. </P>

<H2>G.4.3 Determining the order of Flight movement </H2>

<P>To determine in which order the flight movements are carried out, the player
with the lowest total population decides in which position of the round he wishes
to move. He marks this with the corresponding number counter on the text space of
his central warehouse. Then the player with the next highest population decides
and so on. At last the player with the highest population takes the remaining
position. When there is a tie for population amount, the next criteria or
deciding is the total stockpile of provisions. Whoever has the lowest value
decides first. If this is equal, then the following values are then into
consideration first, with the smallest value determining who goes first. </P>

<P>Number of planets, size of fighter fleet, size of transporter fleet, number of
factories, number of hangars, home planet number.</P>

<H2>G.4.4 Carrying out flight movement</H2>

<P>In Ashes of Empire it is possible to reach each planet from each of the other planets. Th
etime requred can be read off the distance table at teh end of the rules. We offer two variants.
On the planet boards there is the orbit space as well as the flight spaces 1,2 and 3. Now the
cross table is used - the 0 corresponds to the orbit space an dthe numbers 1,2 and 3
correspond top their counterparts on the planet boards. So if one wished tof ly from Outpost
(10) to Mechamea (12), you would findon the table a 2. The fleet is then placed on the 2
space of the planet board 12. If there is already a fleet of the same player, the both fleets
combine into one. The planet list functions in a similar way. Here you find the value &quot;D&quot;
with an additional number. This number corresponds to its counterpart number on theplanet
board. If there is only a &quot;D&quot;, then the fleet isplace immediately in the orbit o fthe planet
aimed for. This is, for example, the case with a flight from Crab (2) to Outpost (10). You
can only send out what is on the start planet. </P>

<P>It is up to the player to decide whether he sends the total fleeet of a planet to one other
planet or whether he splits it up.</P>

<P>A fleet which is on a number space cannot be sent back. A flight order for a fleet can only
be given whenit is in the orbit space.</P>

<P>Rival fleets which are on the same number space do not fight. </P>

<P>Now for the actual movement.</P>

<P>First of all the fleets on the number spaces are moved forward by one space this means
moving ontl the next smallest number and so nearer to the planet. The players move
according to the order established in G.4.3. Each player can if he wishes move all his fleets
which are in a planet obit. He moves his fleet - he places the corresponding counter on the
corresponding space on the table on the current planet. If a fleet comes from the &quot;distance&quot;
(Entferning) space into teh orbit space, then the player cannot move this fleet again this
round. In this phase there is the possibility to change one's home planet. The homeplanet is
where your fleet retreat when beatn in a space battle. Even if this planet is lost, you do not
lose your central warehouse. It can also be moved without there being any direct danger .
You can only appoint one planet to be a home planet. If you lose you home planet you are
forced to find a new one from amongst your remaining planets. </P>

<H2>G.4.5 Carrying our building orders</H2>

<P>The buidling orders are now carried out - simply place the counter on et order sheet into the
corresponding planet. With building, the raw material just used is removed from the central
warehouse board. The system of the flight and building order maya pear strange, but it
prevents a building order being made as a direct reaction to an enemy flight movement.</P>

<H2>G.4.6 Revolt</H2>

<H2>A.4.9.1 Defence strength of neutral planets </H2>

<P>As in the basic game.</P>

<H2>A.4.9.2 Space battles</H2>

<P>With the inclusion of political relationships (A.4.1), it is possible that more than one player
can defend a planet. To determine who is an attacker, defender, and spectator you have to
look at the political relationships of the planet owner. It is possible that two rival players will
attack a planet together, if they are both hostile to the planet owner. In such a case they do
not fight against each other.</P>

<P>Each player throws one die once for each of his fighters. The result of the dice throw of each
player is added together, divided by 6 and rounded off. If more than one player is represented
on the opponent's side, then the player who shot them down decides who suffers, or it is
decided by a die throw who suffers the losses. </P>

<P>The Alliance with the lowest total numerical losses wins. The losing alliance flees to their
home planets.</P>

<H2>A.4.9.3 Land attempts</H2>

<P>As in the basic game.</P>

<H2>A.4.9.4 Equipping</H2>

<P>After the first conquering of a neutral planet, the planet receives a factory of the player's
choice. This does not apply if the planet has been already under a player's control and has
no factory because the previous owner has transported it away to another planet.</P>

<H2>A.4.10 Producing Provisions</H2>

<P>On each planet built factories produce wares depending on the planet's population.</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD>1 to 3</TD><TD>1 raw material per factory</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4 to 6</TD><TD>2 raw materials per factory</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>7 to 8</TD><TD>3 raw materials per factory</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>9     </TD><TD>4 raw materials per factory</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>A.4.11 Other elements to the &quot;extension&quot;game </H2>

<P>Neutral planets produce after achieving independence or after an unsuccessful
landing attempt sufficient fighter and ground troops so as to replenish them up
to their quantity at the start.</P>

<P>You can also &quot;convert&quot; factories as in the basic game. </P>

<H2>Additional Rules/ Game End</H2>

<H2>2.5 Morale</H2>

<P>If a player is successful with his ground troops in warding off a land attempt by a
numerically larger attacking transporter fleet, he can place his morale counter for his troops
face up in front of him.</P>

<P>With the victory of a transporter fleet against stronger ground troops, the morale counter for
the transporters is place face up. Likewise for fighters against a stronger fleet of fighters.</P>

<P>In all following battles, an extra die is thrown for each 4 battle units (with ground troops for
each 3 battle units)</P>

<P>If a player loses a battle against inferior troops and his units have their morale counter face
up, then he must remove the morale counter. </P>

<H2>2.6 End Game - Regular Game</H2>

<P>From the 11th round onwards 5 dice must be thrown to see if the game ends. </P>

<UL>
<LI>It ends in the 11th round with a total throw of 30 
<LI>It ends in the 12th round with a total throw of 29 
<LI>It ends in the 13th round with a total throw of 28 
<LI>It ends in the 14th round with a total throw of 27 
<LI>It ends in the 15th round with a total throw of 26
</UL>

<P>With each further game round the required total sum reduces by 2. </P>

<H2>2.6.2	Premature End</H2>

<P>The game ends if a player is successful in owning 18 planets (22 in the 2 player game) at the
end of a round.He is the winner regardless of the number of points he has. </P>

<H2>2.6.3	Winner according to points</H2>

<P>A player receives the following points : </P>

<UL>
<LI>5 for each planet
<LI>1 for each &quot;1&quot; fighter
<LI>1 for each &quot;1&quot; transporter
<LI>1 for each &quot;1&quot; ground troop
<LI>1 for each &quot;1&quot; factory
<LI>1 for each &quot;1&quot; hangar
<LI>1 for every 3 raw material units</P>
